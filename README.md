> Making HTML emails comfortable for the Rails rockstars

Roadie tries to make sending HTML emails a little less painful in Rails 3+ by inlining stylesheets and rewrite relative URLs for you.

If you want to have this in Rails 2, please see [MailStyle](https://www.github.com/purify/mail_style).

How does it work?
-----------------

Email clients have bad support for stylesheets, and some of them blocks stylesheets from downloading. The easiest way to handle this is to work with all styles inline, but that is error prone and hard to work with as you cannot use classes and/or reuse styling.

This gem helps making this easier by automatically inlining stylesheet rules into the document before sending it. You just give it a list of stylesheets and it will go though all of the selectors assigning the styles to the maching elements. Careful attention has been put into rules being applied in the correct order, so it should behave just like in the browser¹.

Roadie also rewrites all relative URLs in the email to a absolute counterpart, making images you insert and those referenced in your stylesheets work. No more headaches about how to write the stylesheets while still having them work with emails from your acceptance environments.

¹: Of course, rules like `:hover` will not work by definition. Only static styles can be added.

Build Status
------------

[![Build history and status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/Mange/roadie.png)](http://travis-ci.org/#!/Mange/roadie)

Tested with [Travis CI](http://travis-ci.org) using [almost all combinations of](http://travis-ci.org/#!/Mange/roadie):

* Ruby:
  * MRI 1.8.7
  * MRI 1.9.3
  * MRI 2.0.0
* Rails
  * 3.0
  * 3.1
  * 3.2
  * 4.0 beta1

Let me know if you want any other combination supported officially.

### Versioning ###

This project follows [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/) and has been since version 1.0.0.

Features
--------

* Supports Rails' Asset Pipeline and simple filesystem access out of the box
* You can add support for CSS from any place inside your apps
* Writes CSS styles inline
  * Respects `!important` styles
  * Does not overwrite styles already present in the `style` attribute of tags
  * Supports the same CSS selectors as [Nokogiri](http://nokogiri.org/) (use CSS3 selectors in your emails!)
* Makes image urls absolute
  * Hostname and port configurable on a per-environment basis
* Makes link `href`s absolute
* Automatically adds proper html skeleton when missing (you don't have to create a layout for emails)²

²: This might be removed in a future version, though. You really ought to create a good layout and not let Roadie guess how you want to have it structured

Install
-------

Add the gem to Rails' Gemfile

```ruby
gem 'roadie'
```

Configuring
-----------

Roadie listens to the following options (set in `Application.rb` or in your environment's configuration files:

* `config.roadie.enabled` - Set this to `false` to disable Roadie from working on your emails. Useful if you want to disable Roadie in some environments.
* `config.action_mailer.default_url_options` - Used for making URLs absolute.
* `config.assets.enabled` - If the asset pipeline is turned off, Roadie will default to searching for assets in `public/stylesheets`.
* `config.roadie.provider` - Set the provider manually, ignoring all other options. Use for advanced cases, or when you have non-default paths or other options.

Usage
-----

Just add a `<link rel="stylesheet" />` or `<style type="text/css"></style>` element inside your email layout and it will be inlined automatically.

**Note:** Do not use `stylesheet_link_tag` in your mail views. Just use a regular tag pointing to the logical asset name instead; e.g. `emails.css` instead of `emails-<SHA>.css`. This should hopefully be fixed in a later version. You are recommended to use the `:css` option to the mailer (detailed below) instead if you want to avoid problems with this.

You can also specify the `:css` option to mailer to have it inlined automatically without you having to make a layout:

```ruby
class Notifier < ActionMailer::Base
  default :css => :email, :from => 'support@mycompany.com'

  def registration_mail
    mail(:subject => 'Welcome Aboard', :to => 'someone@example.com')
  end

  def newsletter
    mail(:subject => 'Newsletter', :to => 'someone@example.com', :css => [:email, :newsletter])
  end
end
```

This will look for a css file called `email.css` in your assets. The `css` method can take either a string, a symbol or an array of both. The ".css" extension will be added automatically.

### Image URL rewriting ###

If you have `default_url_options[:host]` set in your mailer, then Roadie will do it's best to make the URLs of images and in stylesheets absolute.

In `application.rb`:

```ruby
class Application
  config.action_mailer.default_url_options = {:host => 'example.com'}
end
```

If you want to to be different depending on your environment, just set it in your environment's configuration instead.

### Ignoring stylesheets ###

By default, `style` and `link` elements in the email document's `head` are processed along with the stylesheets and removed from the `head`.

You can set a special `data-immutable="true"` attribute on `style` and `link` tags you do not want to be processed and removed from the document's `head`. This is the place to put things like `:hover` selectors that you want to have for email clients allowing them.

Style and link elements with `media="print"` are always ignored.

### Inlining link tags ###

Any `link` element that is part of your email will be linked in. You can exclude them by setting `data-immutable` as you would on normal `style` elements. Linked stylesheets for print media is also ignored as you would expect.

If the `link` tag uses an absolute URL to the stylesheet, it will not be inlined. Use a relative path instead:

```html
<head>
  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/assets/emails/rock.css">             <!-- Will be inlined -->
  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="http://www.metal.org/metal.css">      <!-- Will NOT be inlined -->
  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/assets/jazz.css" media="print">      <!-- Will NOT be inlined -->
  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/ambient.css" data-immutable>         <!-- Will NOT be inlined -->
</head>
```

Writing your own provider
-------------------------

A provider handles searching CSS files for you. You can easily create your own provider for your specific app by subclassing `Roadie::AssetProvider`. See the API documentation for information about how to build them.

Example Subclassing the `AssetPipelineProvider`:

```ruby
# application.rb
config.roadie.provider = UserAssetsProvider.new

# lib/user_assets_provider.rb
class UserAssetsProvider < Roadie::AssetPipelineProvider
  def find(name)
    super
  rescue CSSFileNotFound
    user = User.find_by_name(name)
    raise unless user
    user.custom_css
  end
end
```

Bugs / TODO
-----------

* Improve overall performance
* Clean up stylesheet assignment code
* Assets referenced with digest URLs should be findable
  * Roadie should be able to have multiple asset providers in a specific order

FAQ
---

### I'm getting segmentation faults (or other C-like problems)! What should I do? ###

Roadie uses Nokogiri to parse the HTML of your email, so any C-like problems like segfaults are likely in that end. The best way to fix this is to first upgrade libxml2 on your system and then reinstall Nokogiri.
Instructions on how to do this on most platforms, see [Nokogiri's official install guide](http://nokogiri.org/tutorials/installing_nokogiri.html).

### My `:hover` selectors don't work. How can I fix them? ###

Put any styles using `:hover` in a separate stylesheet and make sure it is ignored. (See "Ignoring stylesheets" above)

### My `@media` queries don't work. How can I fix them? ###

Put any styles using them in a separate stylesheet and make sure it is ignored. (See "Ignoring stylesheets" above)

### My vendor-specific styles don't work. How can I fix them? ###

Put any styles using them in a separate stylesheet and make sure it is ignored. (See "Ignoring stylesheets" above)
