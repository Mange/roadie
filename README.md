**Note: This README details the 3.x version of Roadie. You might be using 2.x, which is much older and only for Rails.**

> Making HTML emails comfortable for the Ruby rockstars

Roadie tries to make sending HTML emails a little less painful by inlining stylesheets and rewriting relative URLs for you inside your emails.


How does it work?
-----------------

Email clients have bad support for stylesheets, and some of them blocks stylesheets from downloading. The easiest way to handle this is to work with all styles inline, but that is error prone and hard to work with as you cannot use classes and/or reuse styling.

This gem helps making this easier by automatically inlining stylesheet rules into the document before sending it. You just give it a list of stylesheets and it will go though all of the selectors assigning the styles to the maching elements. Careful attention has been put into rules being applied in the correct order, so it should behave just like in the browser¹.

Roadie also rewrites all relative URLs in the email to a absolute counterpart, making images you insert and those referenced in your stylesheets work. No more headaches about how to write the stylesheets while still having them work with emails from your acceptance environments.

¹: Of course, rules like `:hover` will not work by definition. Only static styles can be added.

Features
--------

* Writes CSS styles inline
  * Respects `!important` styles
  * Does not overwrite styles already present in the `style` attribute of tags
  * Supports the same CSS selectors as [Nokogiri](http://nokogiri.org/) (use CSS3 selectors in your emails!)
* Makes image urls absolute
  * Hostname and port configurable on a per-environment basis
* Makes link `href`s and `img` `src`s absolute
* Automatically adds proper html skeleton when missing (you don't have to create a layout for emails)²
* Allows you to inject stylesheets in a number of ways, at runtime

²: This might be removed in a future version, though. You really ought to create a good layout and not let Roadie guess how you want to have it structured.

Install & Usage
---------------

[Add this gem to your Gemfile as recommended by Rubygems](http://rubygems.org/gems/roadie) and run `bundle install`.

```ruby
gem 'roadie', '~> x.y.0'
```

You may then create a new instance of a Roadie document:

```ruby
document = Roadie::Document.new "<html><body></body></html>"
document.add_css "body { color: green; }"
document.transform
    # => "<html><body style=\"color:green;\"></body></html>"
```

Your document instance can be configured several options:

* `url_options` - Dictates how absolute URLs should be built.
* `asset_providers` - A single (or list of) asset providers that are invoked when external CSS is referenced. See below.
* `before_transformation` - A callback run before inlining starts.
* `after_transformation` - A callback run after inlining is completed.

### Making URLs absolute ###

In order to make URLs absolute you need to first configure the URL options of the document.

```ruby
html = '... <a href="/about-us">Read more!</a> ...'
document = Roadie::Document.new html
document.url_options = {host: "myapp.com", protocol: "https"}
document.transform
  # => "... <a href=\"https://myapp.com/about-us\">Read more!</a> ..."
```

The following URLs will be rewritten for you:
* `a[href]` (HTML)
* `img[src]` (HTML)
* `url()` (CSS)

### Referenced stylesheets ###

By default, `style` and `link` elements in the email document's `head` are processed along with the stylesheets and removed from the `head`.

You can set a special `data-roadie-ignore` attribute on `style` and `link` tags that you want to ignore (the attribute will be removed, however). This is the place to put things like `:hover` selectors that you want to have for email clients allowing them.

Style and link elements with `media="print"` are also ignored.

```html
<head>
  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/assets/emails/rock.css">         <!-- Will be inlined -->
  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="http://www.metal.org/metal.css">  <!-- Will NOT be inlined; absolute URL -->
  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/assets/jazz.css" media="print">  <!-- Will NOT be inlined; print style -->
  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/ambient.css" data-roadie-ignore> <!-- Will NOT be inlined; ignored -->
  <style></style>                    <!-- Will be inlined -->
  <style data-roadie-ignore></style> <!-- Will NOT be inlined; ignored -->
</head>
```

Roadie will use the given asset providers to look for the actual CSS that is referenced. If you don't change the default, it will use the `Roadie::FilesystemProvider` which looks for stylesheets on the filesystem, relative to the current working directory.

Example:

```ruby
# /home/user/foo/stylesheets/primary.css
body { color: green; }

# /home/user/foo/script.rb
html = <<-HTML
<html>
  <head>
  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/stylesheets/primary.css">
  </head>
  <body>
  </body>
</html>
HTML

Dir.pwd # => "/home/user/foo"
document = Roadie::Document.new html
document.transform # =>
                   # <!DOCTYPE html>
                   # <html>
                   #   <head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8"></head>
                   #   <body style="color:green;"></body>
                   # </html>
```

If a referenced stylesheet cannot be found, the `#transform` method will raise an `Roadie::CssNotFound` error. If you instead want to ignore missing stylesheets, you can use the `NullProvider`.

### Configuring providers ###

You can write your own providers if you need very specific behavior for your app, or you can use the built-in providers.

Included providers:
* `FilesystemProvider` - Looks for files on the filesystem, relative to the given directory unless otherwise specified.
* `ProviderList` – Wraps a list of other providers and searches them in order. The `asset_providers` setting is an instance of this. It behaves a lot like an array, so you can push, pop, shift and unshift to it.
* `NullProvider` - Does not actually provide anything, it always finds empty stylesheets. Use this in tests or if you want to ignore stylesheets that cannot be found by your other providers.

If you want to search several locations on the filesystem, just declare that:

```ruby
document.asset_providers = [
  Roadie::FilesystemProvider.new(App.root.join("resources", "stylesheets")),
  Roadie::FilesystemProvider.new(App.root.join("system", "uploads", "stylesheets")),
]
```

If you want to ignore stylesheets that cannot be found instead of crashing, push the `NullProvider` to the end:

```ruby
document.asset_providers << Roadie::NullProvider.new
```

### Writing your own provider ###

Writing your own provider is also easy. You just need to provide:
 * `#find_stylesheet(name)`, returning either a `Roadie::Stylesheet` or nil.
 * `#find_stylesheet!(name)`, returning either a `Roadie::Stylesheet` or raising `Roadie::CssNotFound`.

```ruby
class UserAssetsProvider
  def initialize(user_collection)
    @user_collection = user_collection
  end

  def find_stylesheet(name)
    if name =~ %r{^/users/(\d+)\.css$}
      user = @user_collection.find_user($1)
      Roadie::Stylesheet.new("user #{user.id} stylesheet", user.stylesheet)
    end
  end

  def find_stylesheet!(name)
    find_stylesheet(name) or raise Roadie::CssNotFound.new(name)
  end

  # Instead of implementing #find_stylesheet!, you could also:
  # include Roadie::AssetProvider
end

# Try to look for a user stylesheet first, then fall back to normal filesystem lookup.
document.asset_providers = [
  UserAssetsProvider.new(app),
  Roadie::FilesystemProvider.new('./stylesheets'),
]
```

You can test for compliance by using the built-in RSpec examples:

```ruby
require 'spec_helper'
require 'roadie/rspec'

describe MyOwnProvider do
  # Will use the default `subject` (MyOwnProvider.new)
  it_behaves_like "roadie asset provider", valid_name: "found.css", invalid_name: "does_not_exist.css"

  # Extra setup just for these tests:
  it_behaves_like "roadie asset provider", valid_name: "found.css", invalid_name: "does_not_exist.css" do
    subject { MyOwnProvider.new(...) }
    before { Whatever.stub ... }
  end
end
```

### Callbacks ###

Callbacks allow you to do custom work on documents before they are inlined. The Nokogiri document tree is passed to the callable:

```ruby
class TrackNewsletterLinks
  def call(document)
    document.css("a").each { |link| fix_link(link) }
  end

  def fix_link(link)
    divider = (link['href'] =~ /?/ ? '&' : '?')
    link['href'] = link['href'] + divider + 'source=newsletter'
  end
end

document.before_transformation = { |document| logger.debug "Inlining document with title #{document.at_css('head > title').try(:text)}" }
document.after_transformation = TrackNewsletterLinks.new
```

Build Status
------------

Tested with [Travis CI](http://travis-ci.org) using:

* MRI 1.9.3
* MRI 2.0.0
* MRI 2.1.2
* JRuby (latest)
* Rubinius >= 2.1 (experimental)

[(Build status)](http://travis-ci.org/#!/Mange/roadie)

Let me know if you want any other VM supported officially.

Rubinius support is experimental since it currently hindered by a Rubinius bug that will probably be fixed shortly.

### Versioning ###

This project follows [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/) and has been since version 1.0.0.

FAQ
---

### I'm getting segmentation faults (or other C-like problems)! What should I do? ###

Roadie uses Nokogiri to parse the HTML of your email, so any C-like problems like segfaults are likely in that end. The best way to fix this is to first upgrade libxml2 on your system and then reinstall Nokogiri.
Instructions on how to do this on most platforms, see [Nokogiri's official install guide](http://nokogiri.org/tutorials/installing_nokogiri.html).

### My `:hover` selectors don't work. How can I fix them? ###

Put any styles using `:hover` in a separate stylesheet and make sure it is ignored. (See "Ignoring stylesheets" above)

### My `@media` queries don't work. How can I fix them? ###

Put any styles using them in a separate stylesheet and make sure it is ignored. (See "Ignoring stylesheets" above)

### My vendor-specific styles don't work. How can I fix them? ###

Put any styles using them in a separate stylesheet and make sure it is ignored. (See "Ignoring stylesheets" above)
