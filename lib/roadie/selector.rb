  # A selector is a domain object for a CSS selector, such as:
  #   body
  #   a:hover
  #   input::placeholder
  #   p:nth-of-child(4n+1) .important a img
  #
  # "Selectors" such as "strong, em" are actually two selectors and should be
  # represented as two instances of this class.
  #
  # This class can also calculate specificity for the selector and answer a few
  # questions about them.
  #
  # Selectors can be coerced into Strings, so they should be transparent to use
  # anywhere a String is expected.

    # (like +::placeholder+, +::before+) or a pseudo function (like +:active+).

    # We cannot inline styles that appear inside "@" constructs, like +@keyframes+.
