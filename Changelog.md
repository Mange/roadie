### 3.4.0

[full changelog](https://github.com/Mange/roadie/compare/v3.3.0...v3.4.0)

* Enhancements
  * Better support for media queries - [BroiSatse (Stanislaw
    Klajn)](https://github.com/BroiSatse) and [jeznag (Jeremy
    Nagel)](https://github.com/jeznag) (#157).

    Media queries should no longer be inlined in your HTML; instead they should
    appear in `<head>` if `keep_uninlinable_css` is enabled. By default different
    media query blocks with the same conditions will be merged together (which
    might change specificity), but this behavior can be disabled by setting
    `merge_media_queries` to `false`.

  * Remove Guard as a development dependency. Tests run fast anyway, and I
    never liked that this tool "infected" the dependencies of the project when
    it should remain a user-specific tool unless the project wants to enforce
    it.

### 3.3.0

[full changelog](https://github.com/Mange/roadie/compare/v3.2.2...v3.3.0)

  * Support partial HTML documents (fragments) - #147
    * With the help of [andfx](https://github.com/andfx) - #115
    * With the help of [Frida Sjoholm](https://github.com/FridaSjoholm) - #146
  * Skip URL rewriting on elements with `data-roadie-ignore` - #154.
    * With the help of [Hamed Asghari](https://github.com/hasghari) - #138.
* Bug fixes:
  * Apply correct string encoding / charset in `NetHttpProvider` - [Jeremy Nagel](https://github.com/jeznag) (#152).

### 3.2.2

[full changelog](https://github.com/Mange/roadie/compare/v3.2.1...v3.2.2)

* Enhancements

  * Support `css_parser` 1.x.
  * Make tests pass on Ruby 2.4.0 (upgrade Webmock).

### 3.2.1

[full changelog](https://github.com/Mange/roadie/compare/v3.2.0...v3.2.1)

* Enhancements
  * Support Nokogiri 1.7.x.

### 3.2.0

[full changelog](https://github.com/Mange/roadie/compare/v3.1.1...v3.2.0)

* Deprecations:
  * Dropped support for MRI 1.9.3.
  * Dropped support for MRI 2.0.
* Upgrades:
  * Use `css_parser` 1.4.x instead of 1.3.x.
* Bug fixes:
  * Strip UTF-8 BOM (Byte Order Mark) from stylesheets before parsing / concatenating - [Bartłomiej Wójtowicz](https://github.com/qbart) (#128)
* Enhancements:
  * Build against Ruby MRI 2.3.0 too.
  * Don't add extra whitespace between table cells.

### 3.1.1

[full changelog](https://github.com/Mange/roadie/compare/v3.1.0...v3.1.1)

* Enhancements:
  * Duplicate style properties are now removed when inlining.
    * This means that `color: green; color: red; color: green` will now be `color: red; color: green`.
    * The size of your emails should be the same, or smaller.

### 3.1.0

[full changelog](https://github.com/Mange/roadie/compare/v3.1.0.rc1...v3.1.0)

* Enchancements:
  * `NetHttpProvider` validates the whitelist hostnames; passing an invalid hostname will raise `ArgumentError`.
  * `NetHttpProvider` supports scheme-less URLs (`//foo.com/`), defaulting to `https`.

### 3.1.0.rc1

[full changelog](https://github.com/Mange/roadie/compare/v3.0.5...v3.1.0.rc1)

* Enhancements:
  * Allow user to specify asset providers for referenced assets with full URLs and inline them (#107)
  * Pass `Document` instance to transformation callbacks (#86)
  * Made `nokogiri` dependency more forgiving.
    * Supports `1.5.0`...`1.7.0` now instead of `1.6.0`...`1.7.0`. Some people out there are stuck on this older version of Nokogiri, and I don't want to leave them out.
  * Output better errors when no assets can be found.
    * The error will now show which providers were tried and in which order, along with the error message from the specific providers.
    * `Roadie::FilesystemProvider` shows the given path when inspected.
  * `data-roadie-ignore` attributes will now be removed from markup; hiding "development markers" in the final email.
  * Add a `Roadie::CachedProvider` asset provider that wraps other providers and cache them.
  * Add a `Roadie::PathRewriterProvider` asset provider that rewrites asset names for other providers.
    * This saves you from having to create custom providers if you require small tweaks to the lookup in order to use an official provider.
* **Deprecations:**
  * `Roadie::Stylesheet#each_inlinable_block` is now deprecated. You can iterate and filter the `blocks` at your own discresion.

### 3.0.5

[full changelog](https://github.com/Mange/roadie/compare/v3.0.4...v3.0.5)

* Bug fixes:
  * Don't try to inline external stylesheets. (#106)
  * Don't generate absolute URLs for anchor links. (Mange/roadie-rails#40)

### 3.0.4

[full changelog](https://github.com/Mange/roadie/compare/v3.0.3...v3.0.4)

* Bug fixes:
  * Schemeless URLs was accepted as-is, which isn't supported in a lot of email clients. (#104)

### 3.0.3

[full changelog](https://github.com/Mange/roadie/compare/v3.0.2...v3.0.3)

[full changelog](https://github.com/Mange/roadie/compare/v3.0.0...v3.0.1)

* Enhancements:
  * `CssNotFound` can take a provider which will be shown in error messages.
* Bug fixes:
  * URL rewriter no longer raises on absolute URLs that cannot be parsed by `URI`. Absolute URLs are completely ignored.
  * URL rewriter supports urls without a scheme (like `//assets.myapp.com/foo`).
  * URL rewriter no longer crashes on absolute URLs without a path (like `myapp://`).

### 3.0.0

[full changelog](https://github.com/Mange/roadie/compare/v3.0.0.pre1...v3.0.0)

* Enhancements:
  * `Roadie::ProviderList` responds to `#empty?` and `#last`
  *   `Roadie::FilesystemProvider` ignores query string in filename.

      Older versions of Rails generated `<link>` tags with query strings in their URLs, like such:
       `/stylesheets/email.css?1380694096`
  * Blacklist `:enabled`, `:disabled` and `:checked` pseudo functions - [Tyler Hunt (tylerhunt)](https://github.com/tylerhunt).
  * Add MRI 2.1.2 to Travis build matrix - [Grey Baker (greysteil)](https://github.com/greysteil).
  * Try to detect an upgrade from Roadie 2 and mention how to make it work with the new version.
  * Styles emitted in the `style` attribute should now be ordered as they were in the source CSS.

### 3.0.0.pre1

[full changelog](https://github.com/Mange/roadie/compare/v2.4.2...v3.0.0.pre1)

Complete rewrite of most of the code and a new direction for the gem.

* Breaking changes:
  * Removed Rails support into a separate Gem (`roadie-rails`).
  * Removed Sprockets dependency and AssetPipelineProvider.
  * Changed the entire public API.
  * Changed the API of custom providers.
  * Dropped support for Ruby 1.8.7.
  * Change `data-immutable` to `data-roadie-ignore`.
* New features:
  * Rewriting the URLs of `img[src]`.
  * A way to inject stylesheets without having to adjust template.
  * A before callback to compliment the after callback.
* Enhancements:
  * Better support for stylesheets using CSS fallbacks.
    This means that styles like this is now inlined: `width: 5em; width: 3rem;`, while Roadie would previously remove the first of the two.
    This sadly means that the HTML file will be much larger than before if you're using a non-optimized stylesheet (for example including your application stylesheet to the email). This was a bad idea even before this change, and this might get you to change.
  * Using HTML5 doctype instead of XHTML
  * Full support for JRuby
  * Experimental support for Rubinius

### 2.4.2

[full changelog](https://github.com/Mange/roadie/compare/v2.4.1...v2.4.2)

* Bug fixes:
  * Fix Nokogiri version to allow only 1.5.x on ruby 1.8.7
  * Blacklist :before, :after, :-ms-input-placeholder, :-moz-placeholder selectors – [Brian Bauer (bbauer)][https://github.com/bbauer].
  * Build failed on 1.8.7 due to a change in `css_parser`

### 2.4.1

[full changelog](https://github.com/Mange/roadie/compare/v2.4.0...v2.4.1)

* Bug fixes:
  * Allow Nokogiri 1.5.x again; 1.6.x is unsupported in Ruby 1.8.7.

### 2.4.0

[full changelog](https://github.com/Mange/roadie/compare/v2.3.4...v2.4.0)

* Enhancements:
  * Support Rails 4.0, with the help of:
    * [Ryunosuke SATO (tricknotes)](https://github.com/tricknotes)
    * [Dylan Markow](https://github.com/dmarkow)
  * Keep `!important` when outputting styles to help combat web mail styles being `!important`
  * Support `:nth-child`, `:last-child`, etc.
    * To make this work, Roadie have to catch errors from Nokogiri and ignore them. A warning will be printed when this happens so users can open issues with the project and tests can be expanded.
  * Support for custom inliner (#58) — [Harish Shetty (kandadaboggu)](https://github.com/kandadaboggu) with friends
* Bug fixes:
  * Don't crash when URL options have protocols with "://" in them (#52).
* Other:
  * Be more specific on which versions are required; require newer `css_parser`
  * Officially support MRI 2.0.0

  * Remove documentation that talks about passing CSS filenames as symbols; unsupported in Rails 4. (Thanks to [PikachuEXE](https://github.com/PikachuEXE))
