[full changelog](https://github.com/Mange/roadie/compare/v2.4.1...master)

* Bug fixes:
  * Fix Nokogiri version to allow only 1.5.x on ruby 1.8.7

### 2.4.1

[full changelog](https://github.com/Mange/roadie/compare/v2.4.0...v2.4.1)

  * Allow Nokogiri 1.5.x again; 1.6.x is unsupported in Ruby 1.8.7.

### 2.4.0

[full changelog](https://github.com/Mange/roadie/compare/v2.3.4...v2.4.0)

* Enhancements:
  * Support Rails 4.0, with the help of:
    * [Ryunosuke SATO (tricknotes)](https://github.com/tricknotes)
    * [Dylan Markow](https://github.com/dmarkow)
  * Keep `!important` when outputting styles to help combat web mail styles being `!important`
  * Support `:nth-child`, `:last-child`, etc.
    * To make this work, Roadie have to catch errors from Nokogiri and ignore them. A warning will be printed when this happens so users can open issues with the project and tests can be expanded.

* Bug fixes:
  * Don't crash when URL options have protocols with "://" in them (#52).
* Other:
  * Be more specific on which versions are required; require newer `css_parser`

  * Remove documentation that talks about passing CSS filenames as symbols; unsupported in Rails 4. (Thanks to [PikachuEXE](https://github.com/PikachuEXE))
