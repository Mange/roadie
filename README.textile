h1. MailStyle

MailStyle tries to make sending HTML emails a little less painful in Rails 3.

It was originally developed for use on "Purify: Awesome Bug & Issue Tracking":http://purifyapp.com

An older version exists for Rails 2 apps (latest is 0.1.6).

h2. How does it work?

Email clients have bad support for stylesheets, and some of them blocks stylesheets from downloading. The easiest way to handle this is to work with all styles inline, but that is error prone and hard to work with.

<pre><code>&lt;div style="padding: 5px; background: #eee">&lt;/div></code></pre>

This gem helps making this easier by automatically inline your stylesheet rules into the document. You just give it a list of stylesheets and it will go though all of the selectors assigning the styles to the maching elements. Careful attention has been put into rules being applied in the correct order, so it should behave just like in the browser.

There's one more problem, though. Referencing images both in @img@ elements and in the stylesheets have to use absolute urls, and these differ in your different environments. MailStyle will replace all relative image sources and all relative urls mentioned in the styles with their absolute counterpart if you configure your mailer.

h2. Features

* Write CSS styles inline
* Corrects image urls
* Automatically adds proper html skeleton when missing (you don't have to create a layout for emails)

h3. What about Sass / Less?

Sass is supported "by accident" as long as the stylesheets are generated and stored in the stylesheets directory. This is the default behavior from sass. You are recommended to add a deploy task that generates the stylesheets to make sure that they are present at all times.

h2. Install

Add the gem to Rails' Gemfile
<pre><code>gem 'mail_style'</code></pre>

h2. Usage

Simply specify the <code>:css</code> option to mailer:

<pre><code>class Notifier < ActionMailer::Base
  default :css => :email, :from => 'jimneath@googlemail.com'
  def welcome_email
    mail(:subject => 'Welcome Aboard', :to => 'someone@example.com')
  end

  def newsletter_email
    mail(:subject => 'Newsletter', :to => 'someone@example.com', :css => [:email, :newsletter])
  end
end</code></pre>
(you could also use the @defaults@ method in ActionMailer)

This will look for a css file called @email.css@ in your @public/stylesheets@ folder. The @css@ method can take either a string, a symbol or an array of both. You should pass the CSS filename without the ".css" extension.

h3. Image URL Correcting

If you have _default_url_options[:host]_ set in your mailer, then MailStyle will do it's best to make the urls of images and in stylesheets absolute.

In @application.rb@:
<pre><code>class Application
  config.default_url_options = {:host => 'example.com'}
end</code></pre>

h3. Ignoring stylesheets

By default, @style@ elements in the email document's @head@ are processed and removed from the @head@.

You can set a special <code>data-immutable="true"</code> attribute on @style@ tags you do not want to be processed and removed from the document's @head@.

Style elements with <code>media="print"</code> are always ignored.

h2. Bugs / Todo

* Improve overall performance
* Clean up stylesheet assignment code
* Allow users to swap between css_parser and csspool
